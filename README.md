The Pickaxe book, named for the tool on the cover, is the definitive reference to Ruby, a highly-regarded,
fully object-oriented programming language. This Second Edition has more than 200 pages of new content, and 
substantial enhancements to the original, covering all the new and improved language features of Ruby 1.8 
and standard library modules.
